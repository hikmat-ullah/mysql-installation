How to install nginx & configure multiple virtual hosts using centos 7
To begin, first install nginx using the following command
# yum install nginx
# systemctl start nginx //if you face any issue, try to stop apache because nginx and apache both run on port 80
# systemctl enable nginx // you don't have to start nginx whenever you bootup your machine
firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
To create virtual hosts, create a file in the /etc/nginx/conf.d directory. To create a file run the following command
and paste in the following content

vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/vhost.host.conf
# create new
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  www.virtual.host;

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/virtual.host;
        index  index.html;
    }
}
Now make a directory and then create a file named index.html and paste in the following content

mkdir /usr/share/nginx/vhost.host
vi /usr/share/nginx/vhost.host/index.html

<html>
<body>
<div style="width: 100%; font-size: 40px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
Nginx Virtual Host Test Page
</div>
</body>
</html>

# systemctl reload nginx

Now type your IP in the browser in the following format 
192.168.174.156:80/index.html
and you will see your new virtual host
